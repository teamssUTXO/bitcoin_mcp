### Option 1: Using UV (Recommended)

UV is a fast Python package installer and resolver.

1. **Install UV** (if not already installed):
```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bitcoin-mcp-server.git
   cd bitcoin-mcp-server
```

3. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
   uv pip install -e .
```

4. **Install to Claude Desktop**:
```bash
   uv run mcp install src/main.py
```

Check [How to configure MCP Server](mcp_config/README.md)

### Option 2: Using Python/Pip

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bitcoin-mcp-server.git
   cd bitcoin-mcp-server
```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the server**:
```bash
   python src/main.py
```

### Option 3: Using Docker

See [README.Docker.md](README.Docker.md) for detailed Docker deployment instructions.

## 🔑 API Information

### No API Keys Required!

The Bitcoin MCP Server uses **free, public APIs** that don't require authentication or API keys. This makes setup incredibly simple - just install and go!

### Data Sources

The server aggregates data from multiple reliable sources:

- **[Blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com)**
- **[Mempool.space](https://mempool.space)**
- **[CoinGecko](https://coingecko.com)**
- **[Alternative](https://alternative.me/crypto/coins/)**

### Fair Use Policy

While these APIs are free and don't require keys, please use them responsibly:

- **Avoid excessive requests**: Don't spam the APIs with rapid-fire queries
- **Rate limiting**: The server implements reasonable delays between requests
- **Be respectful**: These services are provided free of charge to the community
- **Cache when possible**: Results are cached to minimize redundant requests

**Note**: If you plan to use this server at high volume or in a production environment, consider using API keys or self-hosting Bitcoin Core nodes for data access.

---

## ⚠️ Usage Considerations

### Message Limits

Using MCP servers **will consume more tokens** from your AI assistant's message allowance because:

- Each tool call requires additional context to be sent
- Results from APIs add to the total token count
- Complex queries may require multiple tool calls

**Impact**: You may reach your daily message limit faster when using Bitcoin MCP tools extensively.

### Rate Limiting

While the APIs are free, rate limits apply. Intensive usage may result in temporary blocks. Please refer to the client website for specific API usage limits.

---
